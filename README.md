DumpAPI is a Flask-Restful API that contains data of departments and their employees. The API utilizes token generation with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access. All the data is stored in a cloud database provided by Yugabyte, which offers a free PostgreSQL database service. The passwords are hashed and stored in the database for enhanced security.
